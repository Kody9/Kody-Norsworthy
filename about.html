    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Kody Norsworthy, a dedicated and passionate Computer Science graduate from Texas State University, specializing in web development, software engineering, and iOS app development.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Skills and Technologies</h3>
    <p>I am proficient in a range of technologies including JavaScript, Python, React, and Swift. I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development and am continually seeking to refine my skills in these areas.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
    <p>During my studies, I worked on several projects including a dissasember for the ARM assembly language in Golang, a website using the MERN stack, and several others. These experiences helped me develop not only technical skills but also problem-solving and team collaboration skills.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
    <p>In my personal time, I enjoy working on programs in Python to automate daily tasks, developing interactive websites, and creating iOS apps. These projects allow me to explore new technologies and stay current with industry trends, enhancing my problem-solving skills and keeping my programming practices innovative and efficient.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Interests Outside of Technology</h3>
    <p>Aside from my technical interests, I'm also passionate about economics and finance, and I spend a good amount of time keeping up with the latest trends in these fields. I also enjoy spending time outdoors with my dogs, chickens, ducks, and pig, which keeps me connected to nature and provides a refreshing break from the digital world.</p>
